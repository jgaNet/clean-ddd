# Architecture Overview

This project implements a comprehensive architecture that combines Clean Architecture with Domain-Driven Design (DDD). The architecture provides:

- **Separation of concerns**: Organized into distinct layers with well-defined responsibilities
- **Business logic isolation**: Domain logic protected from infrastructure concerns
- **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
- **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries between components

## Clean Architecture

The project follows Clean Architecture principles with concentric layers:

- **Domain Layer** (center): Contains business entities and rules
- **Application Layer**: Contains use cases that orchestrate domain entities
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Contains adapters to external systems
- **Presentation Layer**: Contains controllers and views

Dependencies point inward, with inner layers having no knowledge of outer layers.

## Domain-Driven Design

The project applies DDD principles:

- **Bounded Contexts**: Separate domains with clear boundaries
- **Ubiquitous Language**: Consistent terminology within each context
- **Entity Objects**: Objects with identity and lifecycle
- **Value Objects**: Immutable objects representing attributes
- **Aggregates**: Clusters of entities and value objects with transactional boundaries
- **Repositories**: Abstraction for persistence
- **Domain Events**: Communication of state changes

## Key Architectural Patterns

- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: Commands and queries handled separately
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Communication between bounded contexts via events
- **Result Pattern**: Operations return Result objects rather than throwing exceptions
- **Operation Tracking**: All commands tracked as operations with status and metadata
